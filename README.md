# Club Mahindra DataOlympics (Analytics Vidhya,  3rd - 5th May, 2019)

## Problem Statement

Given around ~300,000 reservations across 32 different hotels/holiday homes of Club Mahindra the objective is to predict the average
spend of customers per room per night stay at the hotel against the booking. A wide variety of attributes on the reservation were 
provided which includes booking_date, checkin_date, checkout_date etc. 

## My Approach
 1. Used fastai tabular learner function for modelling and training.

## Result
 * Pulic Leaderboard - 97.5294587080
 * Private Leaderboard - 98.7186349636

## Improvements needed
 1. Robust feature engineering wasn't done. Probably with good amount of feature engineering rank on leaderboard would have been
    increased. 
 2. I think more training would have also helped in improving the model and leader board score.
